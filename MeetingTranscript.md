00:16
Alexey
Let's take another example like Thailand. Yeah. So we have people who are speaking in Thailand. We know that in Thailand we have some big CC market where domestic PMI is working and they are trying to expand P5. Right. So how many of Thai travelers we have in any of GT3 airport if we do publicity in Thailand is it should be in which locations and it should be promoting which products. Right. So how much advanced ties or Germans. Let's say Germany. Germany is a very mature P1 market. So how many Germans we have and how much of three markets we have this German coverage and what the scope if we start doing this in German like for example consumer hour presentations. I don't know if you attended those with. 

01:27
Alexey
He was one of the point was we need to do our marketing materials in Chinese in Mandarin. Right. So it's exactly the same. So if we would like to address Chinese people. So what how many of them are using which product what their. What is the overall scope? For example we would like to launch on the Chinese audience, Mandarin speaking Chinese audience, the P5 for example P5 oral this pouches and what is the scope and within duty free locations how much. We are covering them. When we say scope is how many lano, how much money they spent, what is their average ticket and where they are located, location on language base and all. So and that's basically the purpose of the finance. 

02:36
Kemal
So it is mostly like it is mostly geographical than finance. Because when I looked at it I. I thought oh we're trying to like tie it to finance specifically. So I thought it is at the end of the day for finance audience but giving it from the geographical angle. But it is actually like geographical rather than specific giving finance reason. But like for products and like are we active in those locations etc what. 

03:10
Alexey
You showing is exactly right thing. 

03:15
Kemal
Maybe so before. Before I. Before I go into that in this one let me just quickly say so that you are well told because it gets a little too much. We have this 3D globe and it makes all the countries that we have an activity is colored the variable or like the metric that we color them. You know it can change the gray ones are the ones that we are like. At least we got zero on that metric. But we can color it differently. It has three different layers or views. So the first one is the global view. It tells us overall globally where we are at, what we're doing, top dimensionalities that are moving, etc. And the financial overview. Don't look into the accuracy of the data. 

04:18
Kemal
You know, I I might have just used the ones that I had, so I'll have to update those. But here and then the third tab, I'm still working on some more interactive and at least visual graphs rather than just writing because I want this to be just looked at, not necessarily like tagged or etc. So I'll put some more stuff in there. The second view is when we click on a country, it basically shows the country level analysis and insights for that country. This can, it can be different than the global view as well. So on globe overall we don't have to know what are the top five airports like in the globe, but on a country you might want to check like what are the top five or like what are the most visiting nationality, etc. 

05:26
Kemal
So we can change those metrics as well. And the third layer is the airport layer. That is when you click on an airport on a country. Again this, I believe this would be a little bit more different than what we gave here because here we might focus on product, we might focus on more financial stuff or we might focus on specifically RRP versus CC stuff. And here we can have some more I guess pointed insights as in like this airport requires like some more RRP or like you know, specifically to this airport. Like for instance Antalya airport in Turkish. Like we have a lot of Russian specific like Russian tourists etc. So we might want to do something for that location. So a little bit more I think specific unpointed inside could go in here. 

06:35
Alexey
It's clear it's a very good tool but I think when you contextualizing it's important to know who is your. And what is use case? What is a particular use case. So I think for this too I like the animation and globe but it's more like who is more or his team who is more target audience who would like to build a strategy to observe and drill down and domain what is going on in particular areas. 

07:08
Kemal
Okay. 

07:09
Alexey
Maybe Barta. I would just also to add maybe extra thing if they want really to zoom in on a trends. That will be very insightful. 

07:18
Kemal
Yeah, I'm holding a timeline. Not a timeline but at least 12 months graph in one of the cases. But you know like there are. 

07:31
Alexey
So let me explain now what is the use case and target audience of DF Macas? Yeah, because I think if you want to incorporate this, it's also important to bear in mind. So this is DF Macass tool. 

07:45
Kemal
Yeah, yeah, I checked it. 

07:47
Alexey
I mean so the Use case is following. You mentioned for example. We would like so. And the target audience is a marketing team like Emma and marketing content providers. 

08:01
Kemal
Okay so yeah, I totally got it. Like a finance related stuff because a lot of financial stuff going on. 

08:08
Alexey
It's not so much finance but it's actually bridging between marketing and finance. So for example they would say okay, we would like to specify all markets but let's say. Let's start with Turkey. We would like to specify on Turkey about what we will be addressing the European nationalities. Right. So or maybe we will be addressing particular airports. Right. So. So we will. We don't have budget for everything but we will be covering Istanbul maybe. Right. And I don't know airport. So. North Cyprus. Right. Turkey and Cyprus. Turkish Cyprus. Right. Turkish Cyprus. So Turkish Cyprus. I don't know which airport you can suggest. Erzan. Er. Erc. Yeah. I don't see it. Probably not there because when you write Cyprus is not the Turkish Cyprus. Okay. Okay. So you should. I think North Cyprus could go there. 

09:32
Alexey
But you put Turkey now that's why it filters for further. No North Macedonia. North Cyprus. Anyway, anyway, just so just like Sabiha. Yeah. So yeah Cyprus. I mean Germany, right. Germany. There is a lot of Turkish in. In. In Germany. So so they say in Berlin let's say right, Berlin and mini airport. Yeah mini crime. Mini crime and Sabiha. And let's say Istanbul. Right? Istanbul is a bit. And maybe I's in poke as well. So they say okay, we are targeting Turks. We will be covering two markets, Turkey and Germany and we are going to smash Turkish audience because there is no RP there. But so. Or there is no P5 or we are going to address particular thing that Turks is focusing. Or we can hook Turks better than any others who are traveling across Germany and Turkey. 

10:58
Alexey
Because in Turkey there is lot of Russians probably who would prefer different things and different marketing materials and nationalities. Let's say Turks and. And yeah, just Turks. Turks there in these locations. In this duty free markets. These locations. What is the total scope? So how much of all travelers we cover there. So if we can hit at the same time all the rest. Okay, it's a 50 of all FL of the Turks in those markets. Right. And how much we can count to estimate our impact on the budget. So how much people would spend there? So we see historically they spend six dollar per one llano given the funnel. So probably the funnel is what is missing here. So how many of total Turks are there? 

11:56
Alexey
How many are get into the shop how many of them do trial and how many eventually do some purchase? So and basically we say, okay, the total pie based on historical. How do you, how do you like, do we have the data? Because I checked the facts. Quantity packs, quantity data. Do we have the. Like, how do we know the. The number of Turks that are CC users for instance? Or we just basically like take the ratio of overall CC users to the portion of Turkish Turks there. Well, first of all, we. We can calculate number of lano. It's also derived from the domestic line of penetration. There is adult rate. Well, but I mean, look, there is a data set behind how we collected the data set. Okay, It's a different story. I mean, yeah, I tried to create this one myself. 

13:04
Alexey
I use PNL and Pegs1. But I could like, the most I could go down was the airport level. So I couldn't go down to the nationality level. Like you're saying to me, like, yeah. But you have national. You don't need to go nationality per airport. You can leverage data of nationality because if you know that In Turkey the P1 is. Is banned. And if you have some observations from somewhere that 5% of Turks buying vapes or 10 of Turks buying vapes and vaping, so you can plug it in and you can expand this assumption. And I mean here, okay, in reality, probably Turks that are traveling in Berlin will be more vapors, maybe 20%, not 15 compared to the Turks that are traveling in Sabiha Airport, which probably will be 12%, not 15 in average. 

14:08
Alexey
But it doesn't stop you to put 15 everywhere and say, okay, this is estimate based on the methodology. If you punctually get more information than in Sabiha at some point of time, they do research and exit poll and see how many vapors they found. And they say Precise number for October 2025 for particularly Sabiha Airport of among all Turks we see there is 17.33% of V. Okay, you just plug it in this particular number in the data set in a cell of months in the cell of Sabiha Airport, in a cell of nationality Turks. But if you don't know that, I mean, you just populate average 15% of the vapors. So it's just about underlying data. I think it's more like more to data. But working with Fatih to build this data set with Fatih and. And Sena. 

15:04
Alexey
Yeah, I talked to Fatih because last Friday I texted you and after that I, I texted Fati as well, because Ed asked me to ask you guys. So he told me about the two and that you're working on this data set. But the thing is like we don't have almost any data on you know like prevalence etc either. So like in country key figures. Okay, maybe it's not fresh but we have some indication and it is already useful for the business because anyway look use case of marketing will be exactly the same. They don't have precise data and they will not be waiting for precise data. They need to based on some assumption to estimate that it works to spend like let's say one million dollar campaign to boost up let's say P5among dirts in this six locations of airports. Right. 

15:56
Alexey
So basically what they do this they need kind of underlying prepared data they can slice and dice and they say okay, this is fine. Maybe we can also include I don't know where the like where the Turks also traveling a lot. I don't know Bulgaria, right? I don't know Bulgaria. Let's just put Netherlands. Amsterdam. Netherlands. Netherlands, Netherlands. They say okay that looks fine but we still have a bit of budget as per our $6 here and total amount we say it will uplift by 1% so it will be 1 million dol 70,000 so maybe we can even cover the third location Netherlands. And they pick that and okay, it's reset. They. They pick the. The airports. I'm just making it randomly. So and they had okay, Eindhoven Airport and maybe let's put Rotterdam and they see at the numbers. Yeah, okay it's. It's crazy. 

17:08
Alexey
Three of them, three of them are. Like yeah, it doesn't matter but they say okay, three of them too much. So it's a kind of interactive playing tool where they can plug in plug out different things to see how the numbers are changing and basically making this much more agile and convenient on their decisioning and choosing like deciding for example should we include only Amsterdam Rotterdam and Amsterdam Rotterdam and Eindhoven by looking on those numbers by looking in total number of packs by combining them in their assumption on the mind of what would be uplift if they do this Turkish media campaign. Well, media campaign in Turkish languages in these three locations and they make this decision because otherwise they would. They would be and well they would. Be like without any. Any indications. Yeah, we're basically just giving them insight on. 

18:07
Alexey
We're not suggesting anything, we're just giving them okay, if you want to focus on this airport this is the case. Like this is. Yeah and they also look concentration of CC versus SFP users And I say okay, if we take this setup and we take only Turks. Turks. Turkey. Turkey. Yep. So they see that it's 100% CCUs. Okay. Okay. Maybe it's false because there is some vape. Right. Dark market right of waves. So maybe the data set have to be adjusted here in the numbers. But I refreshed the F Maas almost a year ago. So maybe some numbers in underlying data set have to be in SF. SFP. Right. Combustible 100 is here. So maybe those numbers have to be adjusted and maybe we need to be like people. 

19:03
Alexey
P5, P1, P4, P5 kind of split breakdown so they can even get more category specific insights. But use case doesn't change, it stays the same. It's more for Alejandro and marketing team to play in an interactive way to see different scenario, different outcomes based on already prepared data set with all assumptions done kind of consistently and documented. By the way, we have documentation for DFMakast methodology so they can optimize their selection rather than going one way based on their gut feel and say okay, we go Netherlands, we take only Amsterdam and then ending up that they either have extra budget that they didn't use or vice versa. They didn't reach the target because they miss underestimated or miss interpreted the funnel or how many passengers will be there, how many lines there. So it gives everything one page and this is use case. 

20:09
Alexey
As for YouTube it's like more to learn and build a strategy decision for ugurts and basi and the team to see which direction they have to go. What is the potential of particular given market. If this market is. So it's less about consumer, it's less about nationality, it's more like more strategic, more high level. So I would not blend this two. I would maybe do two pages because. When you're telling me especially the last part case like scenarios where you would want to look at couple of different airports in different countries. I don't know if I can build that into this because I can feel. Free to download the Jeff Macassar. I mean you can have a separate app of the tool. Yeah. And say okay, there is a page tool which is called the marketing or zoom into consumer story. 

21:10
Alexey
And actually you can recycle all the methodology and underlying data set actually which I hope we will actually build finally with Sienna as a snowflake table just sourcing directly from there. And maybe it will be great for me because I'm at the same time I'm building and the pegs table etc It's. It's a huge table, man. Like it's. I tried to download the PAX table to delve deeper into it like to look at some of the stuff. It's like eight gigabytes by itself. Yeah. But it's very detailed etc. So it's a huge table too. So you know, it's kind of difficult to build it. 

21:53
Alexey
But I think at the beginning we can give point based information and stuff and then I can build in either the airport layer or something that you know, if you want to have more detailed information just visit this dfmakas and put a link to it and people. But Jeff Macas will be shut down as JS Lite. Actually I, when we were building with Hakan, you remember Hakan was there. So actually he built. I just support him on methodology. And so when we built that initially he wanted to do that thing in power bi. But as you rightly said, if just theoretically we consider all airports, which is like 500 airports times potentially 100 nationalities each, right. It's already like 50k times months, times you just take this dimension. You already have 23 million of things. 

23:02
Alexey
So imagine you plug in 23 million with some columns of factual data that have to be calculated on the fly with the DAX formulas. It would crash. It will, it will be not very user friendly and especially when you have to like plug and play and try. Okay, what if we exclude, I don't know, Rotterdam Airport and include now and see the difference. So actually streamlit with pre bufferizing it all this, I mean it's bufferizing all the data there in a small like a hot access database and then you can do that and it's quite, quite fast in responding. So that was the reason, only reason because actually it doesn't write anything into database. So theoretically it could have been built off Snowflake table. If we can create. But well there was a problem of Snowflake streamlit connection with big data sets. 

24:03
Alexey
If, if that is the case. I mean if you can just at least three send me, you know, what you guys did or like what Senna did to create that table. I can, I can ask Dima to create it or I can just create it myself on dev and start building this on it. But again I, I don't think I can give multiple countries multiple airports. Maybe I can do like multiple airports from one country, but that would be a little difficult on react. Look, don't worry, look, you can still go with your things. My kind advice is when you do any solution, I mean that's from my experience of not in gtr. Just bear in mind your target audience because even like making these mistakes even now. 

24:59
Alexey
So he like he had this definition passport for Hassan which Hassan requested but then he start building something that Tariq has requesting and there's two completely different audiences. High level Hassan would like to show something to Bester and Tariq would like to show and discuss something with field force people on the floor. It's, it's. I mean it's a simple thing but not everyone, I mean having this right perspective, keep in mind your target audience and what is the use case, how they will be using it and then remove a lot of troubles later down. The line when you have a solution so much clearer. That's, that's why the first thing like I didn't build this per anyone's request or anything. Like I, I was playing with it myself to learn how it works. 

25:54
Alexey
And then I showed to add saying look, I did something like this with some sample data, like unrelated sample data. Can we use this for anything? And that's when he said oh we have like DF Maas that can benefit from this. But I think when we think about like the whole scope of doesn't it doesn't let this scenario stuff I can still look into. No, but you can still do the imagine I would imagine you have this DF Macass as a side panel. Yeah. And then where they can have this filter. Yeah. And then when they for example select munich and Germany etc. This globe turns and zoom is in like we're highlighting like I don't know Turkey and Germany and Cyprus like as a nice animation visualization that looks fancy and advanced. 

26:45
Alexey
Yeah, I was working on those stuff because like this is also built like as a layer. Like there is an image underneath this and then the country are on a high like elevated layer and when you hover over it they go even higher. So when I was building the airports on top of it took me ages to build the airports because first you have to build it as a point on the ground level and then you have to make them move with the country at the same time when the country arrives and picking and choosing. But yeah, I think what you said last is we can put an option here scenario or like a tab and once that tab is chosen then we can build the build your logic of picking and getting stuff here into it. Yeah, I think that Would be amazing. 

27:42
Alexey
And then you can have ultimate tool that can serve both. Let's say strategy and marketing strategy and the same marketing. So if I mean look, the synergy is always as synergy. Always a good win. Because what I did actually Jeff Makass was a synergy of finance and marketing. Because marketing is always coming very creative saying let's do this, this. And then when they bring the project to the finance start challenging them. They say hey, but I don't know. Typical spend or amount of money we earn in this business is very tiny. So why you are going to spend $1 million to do that. So in order to avoid that in order to bring finance to the marketing. That's how this DF Macass came through. And actually it was quite positively perceived. The only updated for more than a year. 

28:39
Alexey
So it's based on 2023 full year data. So but if you bring also strategic point to Mark. I mean here what you show is basically you bring strategy and marketing together. So it also works if you have in the same tool which can be used in parallel by some marketing guys working with finance and Uber and Bias working with potentially with Mommy that bridge those gaps. And this will be the tool because otherwise it the pain point. They have to be doing iterations. For example strategy ugurts and bicycle says okay, let's do ship channeling or airlines. And then they come to marketing. Marketing or execution. They say what do you suggest how we can do that? I mean we don't have people there. Do we need to hire the. I don't know. I mean in airports we have shop assistants, we can do dt. 

29:40
Alexey
We have. I mean we have dte we have tools. But in shipshane we have none. So and then they go back, they reconsider and redo the things and then they again come back. So and then there is a could be several attention. They lose time if you bring it. One stop shop for all those. Right? Yeah. And which also brings this perspective of the execution. At the same time then you have a. You win your audience target audience and use cases the same for DF Macass. So if you have what Fatih did, he did a simple. He did the reporting portal and promoted it. And actually now everyone knows. I hope that if they want to find something they go to Jeff Portal and search. But at the same time they see some reports that is finance related. 

30:30
Alexey
And accidentally they click or they are curious they click and they also see and they understand okay, this is more broader picture and this is value. Because if there is individual reports, I mean people have a link saved in favorites and they just go every day. But doesn't bring value add. So there is always an asynergy look. One more thing. Just keep it for yourself. The personal side. I got some complaints from finance. The way you can, you're organizing meetings for them. I mean like I, I, I, I tried to organize those meetings like two weeks ago. Right? Yeah, I'm just translating what I heard. Keep it for yourself. I mean bear this in mind. So the guys were saying that you are sending meetings deep in the night for next morning Monday for in order they prepare for it. 

31:32
Alexey
But people already sleeping at that time. Like 3am or 4am I don't remember. Maybe it's exaggeration, maybe it's false. I sent the same meeting four times. Four different times. And they're like oh no, we can't do it at this time because we need to be all the team together. Like there are nine people. And I'm sending it like were supposed to give all the OB stuff last Monday, remember? Like they just submitted today and, and on Thursday, the last time I met with them because they were giving me different time so I could not find the time. So I sent the meeting in the night time. But I thought I scheduled it for, for later anyway on Thursday I, I told them look, it's okay if you, oh, the whole team tells me, oh, we don't know what we put in this. 

32:24
Alexey
Like you didn't give us any time to think. I'm like did you never do ob? Like did you never talk to anyone before me about like what you can ask from data analytics team like Vasili, tell me like, oh, were not prepared for this because we don't know what to say, what it is. I, I sent you this meeting individually two weeks ago, man. Like, I mean come on, it's fine. Look, I'm telling you that so you there is frustration from their side. If you can also anticipate or mitigate this kind of impression, that would be good because otherwise, I mean if they share with me this probably it could also get to Edward this feedback let's say and it will work against you. So if you either like mile down directly with the team or anticipate that with ed, that's how it will. 

33:35
Alexey
You can protect yourself from this. Thank you so much. Thank you. I mean thank you for giving me to be honest. Well, I mean I wasn't expecting them to Say oh, we don't know what to put in ob. Like what we can say to you. We never thought about this. I'm like, you guys, literally, you are the reason why we do ob. You should know what to put in OB and what not to put. I sent the meeting two weeks ago and like I, I can show you the meeting invite. I literally explain everything I say. Like you can put, you know what you ask from DNA team. You can put like this kind of project and that kind of projects literally everything. Right. 

34:21
Alexey
And on top of this like I, I sent this meeting to two weeks ago and then I find four different times to send it and they don't join and then they come to me. Oh, but you didn't show us what to put. Look, I mean like this was me and was silly talking about this was another new time stuff. Look, I'll just show you the meeting. I'm on your side. I'm just giving you this exactly because I'm on your side. Bear this in mind. I mean you don't need to explain me. I'm. I'm with you Just do something so that feedback, I mean because you have right is the. The truth on your side. But interpretation and communication probably can be not on your side. So please ensure that you do something that interpretation also follows the truth. Yeah, so that's it. 

35:18
Alexey
I mean what is your suggestion on. On the like as in what can I do to make it at least not as. Not. Not like you know, I, I'm. I'm a you know, mean not understanding person or like something like that, you know, like what. Look, you can talk to Vasily, to Tibo, to Dema Screen. Just. I do not understand if they have any frustration at etc. But I have, you have a lot of communication with. So in that case I would just go to Ed and maybe ask him if he get any feedback from. From Vasily or anybody from the team like Tipo Vasily, regarding how you do OB preparation. And I sent this one June 23rd literally. No, no, that's fine. You did all the right. But I'm not talking about what you did. 

36:19
Alexey
I'm talking about what is perception of the guys. And if you ask, I mean you're asking what I would do on your place. I would come to it. Yeah, no, I, I would come to it and ask literally. Ed, did you get any feedback from finance team how we do find how we do OB preparation with finance? And there are two options. Ads. First option, Edward Says I haven't received any feedback. I following the email exchange it pretty smooth, right? And the second option, I mean either of the two and the second option I have received some feedback and he tells you what is the feedback and if it feedback can be positive, neutral or negative. And like that. If there is negative you can also have a right to explain that actually there is some reasons for negative. 

37:28
Alexey
So it's I'm just all possible options turning to you. It's either he didn't get any feedback. If he didn't you react, you say okay, in case you would get some feedback. Bear in mind that this is where my struggles probably you already told to it. But in case he says I received the positive feedback, you say yes, happy days. I also have very positive feeling about this. And in case there is negative you would get it right away whenever you're asking rather than during your map assessment. Or one to one where Ed says I put your rating I don't know down because of this x. Yeah 2 instead of 3 because I received this feedback earlier this year in June or July and I mean you can anticipate that so it to prevent this kind of things happening. So that's what I would do. 

38:24
Alexey
I mean I would just go directly to Edward and check with him. But look, I. We didn't have this conversation. I didn't share this informal feedback for you Bear in mind and it's your right to come and check with our boss if there is any feedback. No, no, thank you. I mean I, I thought maybe if I talk to Vasily as well. I mean but yeah, you can talk. To him as well. To me it, yeah it is like surprising that they tell me oh like but we didn't know what to put in ob. Like you know, ask us for a meeting and tell us and you know ask us to just give it. Now look, I, I sent you this meeting three times and I put the same explanation three times. 

39:20
Alexey
Like if you don't read your emails, how is it my problem that I came to the meeting with that expectation? Like look, you can also talk to Vasily or Thibault or to Volkan to gather from them very neutrally their feelings and their feedback on how things are going rather than like justifying or explaining that they did something wrong or you're doing something right. So maybe just collect for them. Maybe this is impression is what I'm sharing with you is wrong. Maybe the people were like didn't drink coffee that morning and that's why they Said this like my wife always tell the things and after she says. I didn't mean to say that. Sorry for that. So I don't know. But collect. Pay attention to this area and see if there is a. What is wrong. 

40:13
Alexey
Look, we also need to close because it's two weeks and then we will be on Portugal and then I will be gone on holidays. RSP stuff, right? Yes, RSP product set up something like 30 minutes, one hour. Alinda is optional. Look at art of calendar and my calendar. And yes, Linda can be as well. Okay, one last question. This is more a fun question and also because you are the guy for this kind of stuff, this application. Do you. I mean, I was thinking of names before. Before I talk to you, but you know, the DF Makasse stuff. Can we name it one of these? It's either Atlas or Globe, but with the. With the definitions that. That you kind of give. Would any of these work? Because I wanted to still give that, you know, the whole world thing. 

41:27
Alexey
Or if not, can you. Can you. Yeah. Can you find something that. Atlas is good. The first one. Airport travel location and analytics system. Okay. Yeah, Atlas. Yeah, Atlas sounds very good. Well, I would still say it's not analytics system, but yeah, we need to. Find another Aidan Airport travel analytics and. Yeah, trial audience. Audience. But then system doesn't go with audience system. Yeah, no, Atlas is good name. You can figure out audience strategy. I think audience strategy would work here. No, analytics and strategy. Yeah, Location analytics and strategy. It's analytics of location. Because you can pick location and you do analytics and. And strategy. Airports travel location analytics strategy. So this is for the tool that you build for strategy. Commercial strategy or goods and basic. This is actually first one is perfect name would be for. 

42:56
Alexey
Because it's exactly Location analytics and strategy. I did not build it for anyone by the way. No one, I mean no one mentioned that it. It is URS or like literally. You're the first one who. Because I don't have an audience. That's. That's why I asked like, can we use this first one. Atlas is good name. Airport travel maybe Travel locations analytics. It's like multiple locations, right? Travel locations analytics and strategy. This is great name. I mean. Yeah, I vote for this. Okay. Atlas. I of course Travel location. It is pretty generic. So you can plug in any solution into that. The one reason why I did not like up I was between Globe and Atlas was that we used a lot of Atlan as well. I didn't want people to mix it with Atlan. So I thought Would that, like, cause any confusion?
