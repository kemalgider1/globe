# Airport Integration Implementation Guide

## Overview
This implementation adds airport visualization to your React Globe app with click-to-show functionality. Airports are only displayed when a country is selected, solving the layer visibility issue you described.

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Replace App.js
Replace your existing `App.js` with the provided airport integration version. This includes:
- Airport data loading from `GEO_DIM_TOUCH_POINT.txt`
- Country selection state management
- Conditional airport display
- Improved country matching logic

### 2. Update Dashboard Component
Replace your `Dashboard.js` with the updated version that includes:
- Country-specific airport display
- Airport statistics and details
- Performance comparison with global averages
- Back navigation functionality

### 3. Add CSS Styles
Add the airport-specific CSS styles to your `Dashboard.css` file. These styles include:
- Airport list styling
- Status indicators (active/inactive)
- Country header and statistics
- Back button styling
- Responsive design considerations

### 4. File Structure
Ensure your file structure includes:
```
public/
  datasets/
    ne_110m_admin_0_countries_with_sales.geojson
    GEO_DIM_TOUCH_POINT.txt
src/
  App.js (updated)
  Dashboard.js (updated)
  Dashboard.css (updated with new styles)
```

## How It Works

### Layer Architecture
1. **Globe Base Layer**: Altitude `0.0` (earth texture)
2. **Countries Layer**: Altitude `0.06` (normal) / `0.12` (hovered)
3. **Airports Layer**: Altitude `0.15` (above countries when visible)

### Visibility Logic
- **Global View**: No airports shown, only countries
- **Country Selected**: Show airports for that country only
- **Country Hovered**: Airports lift to `0.18` if country is also selected

### Data Processing
- Loads airport data from `GEO_DIM_TOUCH_POINT.txt`
- Validates coordinates and required fields
- Filters invalid entries
- Matches airports to countries using multiple strategies:
  - Direct name matching
  - ISO code matching
  - Partial name matching
  - Special case mappings for common country name variations

### Country Matching Strategies
The implementation handles various country name formats:
- "USA" → "United States of America"
- "UK" → "United Kingdom" 
- "Russia" → "Russian Federation"
- And many more common variations

## Features

### Globe Interactions
- **Country Hover**: Visual elevation and color change
- **Country Click**: Shows country-specific dashboard with airports
- **Airport Hover**: Highlights airport with larger size and white color
- **Airport Click**: Logs airport details (extensible for more actions)

### Dashboard Features
- **Global View**: Overview statistics and top countries
- **Country View**: 
  - Country statistics
  - Airport list with details
  - Performance comparison
  - Navigation back to global view

### Airport Information Display
- Airport code and name
- Location coordinates
- City and region
- Active/inactive status
- Color-coded status indicators

## Configuration Options

### Airport Styling
```javascript
// Modify these values in App.js
pointAltitude={0.15}        // Height above countries
pointRadius={1.0}           // Size of airport points
pointColor={() => '#ff6b6b'} // Airport color
```

### Country Selection Highlighting
```javascript
// In getCountryColor function
if (country === selectedCountry) {
  return '#00ffe7'; // Highlight color for selected country
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### No Airports Showing
1. Check that `GEO_DIM_TOUCH_POINT.txt` is in `public/datasets/`
2. Verify file format matches expected CSV structure
3. Check browser console for loading errors
4. Ensure country names in airport data match GeoJSON country names

### Airport Positioning Issues
1. Verify `pointAltitude` is greater than `polygonAltitude`
2. Check coordinate validity (lat: -90 to 90, lng: -180 to 180)
3. Ensure airports have valid `lat` and `lng` properties

### Country Matching Problems
1. Check country name variations in console logs
2. Add custom mappings to the `specialMappings` object
3. Verify country names in both datasets

## Performance Considerations

- Airports are only rendered when needed (country selected)
- Data is loaded once and cached
- Efficient filtering using useMemo
- Validates data during loading to prevent runtime errors

## Extensibility

### Adding More Airport Data
Modify the `parseAirportLine` logic in the airport loading function to extract additional fields from your data file.

### Custom Airport Actions
Extend the `handleAirportClick` function to implement features like:
- Detailed airport modals
- Airport-specific analytics
- Navigation to external airport information

### Enhanced Filtering
Add more sophisticated country matching by extending the `specialMappings` object or implementing fuzzy string matching.

## Testing

1. **Load Application**: Verify global view shows countries without airports
2. **Click Country**: Confirm airports appear only for selected country
3. **Airport Hover**: Check hover effects work properly
4. **Back Navigation**: Ensure return to global view hides airports
5. **Multiple Countries**: Test switching between countries updates airport display

This implementation provides a clean, performant solution to your airport visualization requirements while maintaining the existing country analysis functionality.
