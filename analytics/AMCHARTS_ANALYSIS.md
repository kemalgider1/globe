## ðŸŽ¯ Recommended 3x3 Matrix Implementation

Based on the available chart types, here's a recommended matrix structure for the airport analytics dashboard:

| Level/Tab | Overview | Finance | Analytics |
|-----------|----------|---------|-----------|
| **Global** | Heat Map (Passenger Distribution) | Column Chart with Pies (Revenue by Country) | Pie Chart (PMI Market Penetration) |
| **Country** | Heat Map (Airport Performance) | Step Line Chart (Revenue Progression) | Tree Map (Revenue Distribution) |
| **Airport** | Bar Chart (Top Airports by PAX) | Pie Chart (Revenue by Airport) | Chord Diagram (Hub Connectivity) |

### **Detailed Chart Assignments**:

#### **Global Level**
- **Overview**: Heat Map showing passenger distribution across countries
- **Finance**: Column chart with embedded pie charts showing revenue by country with category breakdown
- **Analytics**: Pie chart showing PMI market penetration (active vs. inactive)

#### **Country Level**
- **Overview**: Heat Map showing airport performance within the selected country
- **Finance**: Step line chart showing revenue progression over time
- **Analytics**: Tree map showing hierarchical revenue distribution

#### **Airport Level**
- **Overview**: Bar chart showing top airports by passenger volume
- **Finance**: Pie chart showing revenue distribution by airport
- **Analytics**: Chord diagram showing hub connectivity and relationships

## ðŸš€ Implementation Strategy

### **Phase 1: Core Charts**
1. **Heat Map** - Most versatile for overview data
2. **Pie Chart** - Essential for market share and distribution
3. **Bar Chart** - Standard for comparisons

### **Phase 2: Advanced Charts**
1. **Step Line Chart** - For time-based progression
2. **Tree Map** - For hierarchical data

{
  nodes: ["Node1", "Node2", ...],
  connections: [
    { source: "Node1", target: "Node2", value: number }
  ]
}
```

## ðŸŽ¨ Styling Considerations

### **Color Schemes**:
