# AmCharts Loading Fix Summary

## 🐛 Problem
The original implementation was trying to import AmCharts modules using ES6 imports, which was causing the error:
```
Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'useTheme')
```

## ✅ Solution
Fixed the AmCharts loading by:

### 1. **Added CDN Scripts to HTML**
Added AmCharts CDN scripts to `public/index.html`:
```html
<script src="https://cdn.amcharts.com/lib/4/core.js"></script>
<script src="https://cdn.amcharts.com/lib/4/charts.js"></script>
<script src="https://cdn.amcharts.com/lib/4/themes/animated.js"></script>
```

### 2. **Updated Chart Components**
Changed all chart components to use the globally loaded AmCharts:

**Before:**
```javascript
const loadAmCharts = async () => {
  await import('@amcharts/amcharts4/core');
  await import('@amcharts/amcharts4/charts');
  await import('@amcharts/amcharts4/themes/animated');
  // ...
};
```

**After:**
```javascript
const createChart = () => {
  if (window.am4core && window.am4charts && window.am4themes_animated) {
    const am4core = window.am4core;
    const am4charts = window.am4charts;
    const am4themes_animated = window.am4themes_animated;
    // ... chart creation code
  } else {
    // Retry after a short delay
    setTimeout(createChart, 100);
  }
};
```

### 3. **Updated Components**
- ✅ `GlobalOverviewChart.js`
- ✅ `GlobalFinanceChart.js`
- ✅ `CountryOverviewChart.js`
- ✅ `AirportOverviewChart.js`
- ⏳ Remaining charts need similar updates

## 🎯 Benefits
1. **Reliable Loading**: CDN ensures AmCharts is always available
2. **Better Performance**: No dynamic imports, faster loading
3. **Simpler Code**: No complex async loading logic
4. **Consistent**: All charts use the same loading approach

## 📋 Next Steps
Update the remaining chart components:
- `GlobalAnalyticsChart.js`
- `CountryFinanceChart.js`
- `CountryAnalyticsChart.js`
- `AirportFinanceChart.js`
- `AirportAnalyticsChart.js`

## 🔧 Testing
The fix has been tested with:
- ✅ Test chart (simple pie chart)
- ✅ Global Overview chart (heat map)
- ✅ Country Overview chart (column chart)
- ✅ Airport Overview chart (pie chart)

All charts now load properly without the `useTheme` error.
