UI
We have 2 BI visualization boards:
Panel (P), Dashboard (D)

We have 3 layers :
Global (G), Country (C), Airport (A)

Let's do the section names these: (Before it was Overview, Details, Analytics)
OVERVIEW (O), FINANCIAL (F), ANALYTICS(A)

so while talking about the second tab on the country level on dashboard we can say simply DCF
