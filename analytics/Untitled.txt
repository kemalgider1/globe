🎯 Result
The GO section now has:
More intuitive visualizations (flow charts vs static pie charts)
Concrete numbers added to all metrics
No basic tables (replaced with interactive grids)
Clear measurement criteria for all categorizations
Removed redundancy between similar charts


🌊 Interactive Revenue Flow Visualization
Visual Design:
Animated flow streams showing revenue movement
CC (red streams) → SFP (blue streams)
Regional nodes (Europe, Asia, Americas)
Thickness = Revenue volume
How it works:
Shows revenue transition from CC to SFP products
Animated particles flowing from CC→SFP regions
Real-time updates as market shifts
Interaction:
Click region → Country drill-down
Hover stream → Revenue amounts
Animation speed = growth rate
🗂️ Top 10 Countries Interactive Grid
Visual Design:
Flag cards in 2x5 grid layout
Hover reveals: PAX: 2.1M, Revenue: $45M, SFP: 28%
Click → Country level (CO)
