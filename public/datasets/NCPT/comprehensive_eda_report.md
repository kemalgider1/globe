- **Central Tendency**: Mean=0.133M, Median=0.000M
- **Variability**: CV=619.3% (extremely high variation)
- **Range**: [0.000, 24.600] million passengers
- **Interpretation**: Most records have very low passenger counts with few high-volume outliers

#### PAX Share - Market Share
- **Distribution**: Highly right-skewed (Skewness: 3.47)
- **Central Tendency**: Mean=5.85%, Median=0.20%
- **Variability**: CV=266.7% (high variation)
- **Range**: [0.000%, 100.000%]
- **Interpretation**: Typical nationality represents small market share with occasional dominance

## 5. Distribution Analysis & Insights

### Key Statistical Patterns

#### 1. Awareness Metrics Characteristics
- **P4 Closed shows highest consistency** (CV=6.8%) - mature, established market
- **P1 and P4 Disposable** show moderate variation (CV~10-11%)
- **P5 shows higher variability** (CV=17.0%) - emerging or niche market
- **All awareness metrics left-skewed or symmetric** - generally high performance

#### 2. Trial Metrics Characteristics
- **Higher variability than awareness** across all categories
- **P5 Trial most variable** (CV=43.4%) - inconsistent conversion
- **P4 Closed most consistent** (CV=20.4%) - reliable trial conversion
- **Right-skewed distributions** suggest room for improvement in most markets

#### 3. Volume Distribution Patterns
- **Extreme concentration** in passenger volumes (PAX Skewness=15.94)
- **Power law distribution** typical of airport traffic patterns
- **Long tail** of small-volume records with few mega-hubs

## 6. Correlation Analysis

### Strong Positive Correlations (r > 0.8)
| Variable Pair | Correlation | Interpretation |
|---------------|-------------|----------------|
| **P1 Awareness ↔ P1 Trial** | r = 0.914 | Strong awareness-trial funnel |
| **P4 Disp Awareness ↔ P4 Disp Trial** | r = 0.892 | Effective conversion process |
| **P5 Awareness ↔ P5 Trial** | r = 0.886 | Consistent funnel performance |
| **P4 Closed Awareness ↔ P4 Closed Trial** | r = 0.842 | Reliable conversion |
| **P4 Disp ↔ P4 Closed Awareness** | r = 0.912 | Product category synergy |

### Weak Correlations (r < 0.3)
- **PAX Volume ↔ P1 Awareness** (r = 0.004): Size doesn't predict performance
- **Cross-category awareness** generally weak: Products serve different needs

### Marketing Funnel Efficiency
- **Consistent strong correlations** between awareness and trial across all products
- **Correlation strength hierarchy**: P1 (0.914) > P4 Disp (0.892) > P5 (0.886) > P4 Closed (0.842)
- **P1 shows most efficient funnel conversion**

## 7. Outlier Analysis

### Outlier Detection Results (IQR Method)
- **PAX Volume**: Multiple extreme outliers expected (major hubs vs. regional airports)
- **Performance Metrics**: Few outliers suggest consistent measurement methodology
- **Trial Rates**: Some outliers indicate exceptionally high or low performing markets

### Data Integrity Assessment
- **No systematic data quality issues** detected
- **Outliers appear legitimate** (representing true performance variations)
- **Consistent measurement scales** across variables

## 8. Feature Engineering Opportunities

### Derived Variables Potential
1. **Conversion Rates**: Trial/Awareness ratios for efficiency analysis
2. **Market Concentration**: Herfindahl index by airport/region
3. **Performance Categories**: High/Medium/Low based on quartiles
4. **Geographic Clusters**: Regional performance groupings
5. **Volume-Performance Interaction**: Size-adjusted performance metrics

### Segmentation Variables

## 9. Data Limitations & Considerations

### Sample Bias Considerations
- **Missing P5 data** (33.2%) may represent selective availability
- **Airport selection criteria** unknown - may not represent full market
- **Nationality sampling** limited to top 10 - excludes long tail

### Temporal Considerations
- **No time dimension** in current dataset
- **Seasonality effects** cannot be assessed
- **Trend analysis** not possible with cross-sectional data

### Measurement Considerations
- **Awareness/Trial definitions** not specified
- **Survey methodology** unknown
- **Response rate variations** by region/nationality possible
